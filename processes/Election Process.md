# OMF Elections Guide

### Best Practices
- 1-3 Election Officials
	- This allows for 1 to step out if running in an election
	- Election Officials can not be the current FIG Chair/Co-Chair due to conflict of interest. This will require someone in that FIG to nominate someone to run the election.
- Set Election Schedule
	- Elections should be held in groups with other FIGs unless there is an urgent case to change the chairs.

#### Election Process (same for all FIGs)

1. Create a draft of the FIG Election for the current FIG Chairs to view and edit changes as needed.
2. Get dates and timelines in order for the election.
3. Create Election notice as a GitHub Issue in the FIG
	1. Example Notice - https://github.com/Open-MV/community/blob/main/templates/ElectionTemplate.md
		1. Update Dates and FIG name as needed
4. In Discord, create an event pointing to the GitHub Issue and using the same issue title to include FIG name, nomination dates, and voting dates.
5. Post the event in the FIG Channel and Announcements channel
6. During the nomination process, monitor channel for questions, monitor the Issue for nominations and acceptances or declines, answer questions in issue or channel, ping for acceptances in channel and send out date reminders.
	- If only 1 person is nominated, then extension of the election nominations would extend for 1 to 2 weeks.
	- If no one is nominated then the one that was suggested would become the chair.
7. Once you have at least 2 nominations you can start preparing the voting survey.
	1. In some cases with 2 candidates, they will decide on chair and co-chair and no vote will be needed.
	1. If they don't decide on a chair/co-chair then a vote should be configured with the following criteria:
		1. Vote should be anonymous but allow for only 1 vote per person. Suggestion to use google survey for the voting process
		1. The candidate with the most votes is chair and the next highest is co-chair
		1. In the case of a tie candidates have the opportunity to work out chair/co-chair roles first or a run-off will take place (Or a coin flip)
8. Results are announced in the Issue and on Channel
